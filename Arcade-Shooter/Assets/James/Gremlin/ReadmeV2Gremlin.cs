README (GremlinV1.unity):

Gremlin idea! uses the Baby Laugh Rap from youtube,
with a gremlin that bounces around the screen rocking
on beat to the song.
States:
* 1st part of song, baby rocks to beat of song and bounces round
moves like the DVD screensaver, also very timy and fast,
so easy to miss and get hit by accident
* pause in song, baby movement pauses,
* 2nd song part starts, baby begins to rock at different pace,
also begins to grow and move towards player now
