# Arcade-Shooter
  This is a video game where you survive waves of enemies as a ship while installing new weapons as you progress through the level. Pick up weapon modules from fallen enemies to becom stronger. Use the WASD keys to move th ship around and fire bullets with the space bar. Use the arrow keys to move the red gremlin cursor around the ship. When you pick up a module it will go into your inventory on the right side. Use the e key to install the module where the gremlin is. Use the q key to remove a module from the gremlin is.
